SmartThings Arduino Shield
==========================

This is an Arduino library for the SmartThings shield. To install, copy the
entire SmartThings directory into the 'libraries' directory in your sketchbook.
Your sketchbook location is set in the Arduino IDE preferences, by default, the
location will be:

- Windows: 'My Documents\Arduino\libraries\SmartThings'
- OSX: '~/Documents/Arduino/libraries/SmartThings'

For more information about installing Arduino libraries see http://arduino.cc/en/Guide/Libraries

Once the library is installed and your shield is plugged on top of your Arduino 
board, open the example sketch SmartThingsShieldLED.ino in the Arduino IDE and
upload it to your board. You can open the Serial Monitor from the Tools menu to
see status output from the library.

To join the shield to your SmartThings hub, go to "Add SmartThings" mode in the
SmartThings app, and then press the Switch button on the shield. You should see
the shield appear in the app and then be able to turn on and off the shield's LED.
